translation issue ex: validation.required
admin permission check on modify
move App\General to a Support Folder
move user permission check changes inside AwebCore project in a separate method
vendop publishing views should go to App\Views folder and not in resources/views; same for lang files
remove getRegistry from Startup controller and let Framework handle it
